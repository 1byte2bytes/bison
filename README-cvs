These notes intend to help people working on the CVS versions of
Bison.

* Requirements

Only the sources are installed in the CVS repository (to ease the
maintenance, merges etc.), therefore you will have to get the latest
stable versions of the maintainer tools we depend upon, including:

- Automake
- Autoconf
- Flex
- Gettext
- CVS Bison itself

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful,
later, a plain `cvs update -P & make' should be sufficient.

* First CVS checkout

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
Bison from CVS.  For the records, you will find all the relevant
information on:

	http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group_id=56

The next step is asking the installation of all the missing files:

	$ ./bootstrap

And there you are!  Just

	$ ./configure && make && make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the CVS master copy:

	$ cvs diff

should output no difference, except maybe the date in po/*.po files.

Enjoy!

* Troubleshooting

Unfortunately the current Gettext still does not include all the
needed tools so that the bootstrapping always perform successfully.

If you experience problems, I suggest the following:

1. Do a regular CVS checkout

2. Fetch a recent tarball in:
   ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/bison/

3. Extract it

4. Override the content of your checkout with the content of this
   tarball, i.e.:
   cp -r bison-1.875c/* bison-cvs

5. Proceed on ./configure && make etc.
