The %union is declared after the user C declarations. It can be
a problem if YYSTYPE is declared after the user part.	[]

Actually, the real problem seems that the %union ought to be output
where it was defined.  For instance, in gettext/intl/plural.y, we
have:

	%{
	...
	#include "gettextP.h"
	...
	%}

	%union {
	  unsigned long int num;
	  enum operator op;
	  struct expression *exp;
	}

	%{
	...
	static int yylex PARAMS ((YYSTYPE *lval, const char **pexp));
	...
	%}

Where the first part defines struct expression, the second uses it to
define YYSTYPE, and the last uses YYSTYPE.  Only this order is valid.
