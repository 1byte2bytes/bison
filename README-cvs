These notes intend to help people working on the CVS versions of
Bison.

* Requirements

Only the sources are installed in the CVS repository (to ease the
maintenance, merges etc.), therefore you will have to the maintainer
tools we depend upon:

- Automake 1.7

- Autoconf 2.54

- Gettext 0.11.5

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful,
later, a plain `cvs update -P & make' should be sufficient.

* First CVS checkout

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
Bison from CVS.  For the records, you will find all the relevant
information on:

	http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group_id=56

The next step is asking the installation of all the missing files:

	$ ./bootstrap

And there you are!  Just

	$ ./configure && make && make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the CVS master copy:

	$ cvs diff

should output no difference, except maybe the date in po/*.po files.

Enjoy!

* Troubleshooting

Unfortunately the current Gettext still does not include all the
needed tools so that the bootstrapping always perform successfully.

If you experience problems, I suggest the following:

1. Do a regular CVS checkout

2. Fetch a recent tarball in:
   http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~akim/download/

3. Extract it

4. Override the content of your checkout with the content of this
   tarball, i.e.:
   cp -r bison-1.49b/* bison-cvs

5. Proceed on ./configure && make etc.
