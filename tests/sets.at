## Broken Closure.  ##
## ---------------- ##

# TC was once broken during a massive `simplification' of the code.
# It resulted in bison dumping core on the following grammar (the
# computation of FIRSTS uses TC).  It managed to produce a pretty
# exotic closure:
#
# TC: Input
#
#    01234567
#   +--------+
#  0| 1      |
#  1|  1     |
#  2|   1    |
#  3|    1   |
#  4|     1  |
#  5|      1 |
#  6|       1|
#  7|        |
#   +--------+
#
# TC: Output
